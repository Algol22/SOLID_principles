/*
By separating interfaces into units,
this principle helps in reducing dependencies
and promoting flexibility in code design

It means that we should design smaller
and more specific interfaces

Machine interface violates the ISP because
it includes methods for both printing and scanning,
which may not be supported by all implementing classes.
